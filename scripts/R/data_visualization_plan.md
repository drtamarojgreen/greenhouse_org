# Data Visualization Plan for Public Mental Health Data

## 1. Objective

The core objective is to support scientific research, policy analysis, and advocacy by creating insightful, high-quality static visualizations from public mental health data. The visualizations are intended for an audience of scientists, researchers, therapists, psychiatrists, and mental health advocates.

## 2. Specific Public Datasets

The analysis will target well-established, publicly-available datasets, such as:

*   **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** from the CDC: A massive annual telephone survey that collects state-level data on health-related risk behaviors and health conditions. We will focus on variables like `_MENTHLTH` (days of poor mental health) and `_RFDEPRE` (depressive disorder).
*   **National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)** from SAMHSA: Provides national and state-level data on the use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and mental health in the United States. We will analyze trends in substance use disorders and their comorbidity with mental illness.
*   **Global Health Observatory (GHO)** from the WHO: Contains country-level data on mental health indicators like suicide rates, prevalence of depression, and health system resources, allowing for international comparisons.

## 3. Data Processing & Analysis Libraries

Before visualization, the data requires significant processing. The plan will leverage the following high-performance R libraries:

### Data Ingestion and Wrangling:
*   **`data.table`**: For extremely fast and memory-efficient reading and manipulation of large datasets (e.g., the multi-gigabyte BRFSS or NSDUH files).
*   **`dplyr` and `tidyr`**: The core Tidyverse libraries for intuitive data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and reshaping. These are essential for preparing data into the "tidy" format required by `ggplot2`.

### Geospatial Data Processing:
*   **`sf` (Simple Features)**: The modern standard for working with spatial data. It will be used to process geographic boundary files (e.g., shapefiles for states or counties).
*   **`tigris`**: To directly download TIGER/Line shapefiles from the US Census Bureau, which can be joined with the health data to create maps.


## 4. Proposed Visualizations (using `ggplot2` and its extensions)

The visualization strategy will focus on creating dense, informative, and aesthetically refined static plots suitable for research papers and reports.

*   **Choropleth Maps**: State or county-level maps showing the
geographic distribution of mental health prevalence or resource availability, created using `ggplot2` with `sf`.
*   **Faceted Small Multiples**: Creating grids of plots (`facet_wrap`) to compare trends and distributions across many different demographic subgroups (e.g., breaking down trends by age, gender, and ethnicity simultaneously).
*   **Advanced Statistical Plots**:
    *   **Ridge Plots** (using the `ggridges` package) to visualize changes in distribution of a variable over time or across groups.
    *   **Violin plots combined with boxplots** to provide a rich summary of distributions.
    *   **Heatmaps** (using `geom_tile`) to display correlation matrices or complex multi-dimensional relationships.

## 5. Reproducible Reporting

All visualizations and analyses will be embedded within **R Markdown** (`rmarkdown`) documents. This creates a self-contained, reproducible report that combines the code, its output, and narrative text, which is the gold standard for scientific analysis.
