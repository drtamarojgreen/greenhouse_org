# Acoustic Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This project contains a suite of Python and R scripts that demonstrate a machine learning pipeline. The pipeline is designed to assess and search research from PubMed and clinical trials and compare it to an in-house model. The in-house model is trained on assessing frequency signals generated by the notes of classical music and assesses human reaction to sound.

## How to Use

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: R dependencies will need to be installed separately within an R environment.)*

2.  **Run the Pipeline:**
    Execute the main pipeline script from the `scripts/acoustic` directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The `main.py` script will orchestrate the execution of the individual scripts in the correct order.

## Scripts

### Data Acquisition

*   `src/data_acquisition/01_fetch_pubmed_data.py`: Fetches research data from PubMed.
*   `src/data_acquisition/02_fetch_clinical_trials_data.py`: Fetches data from clinical trials.
*   `src/data_acquisition/03_generate_inhouse_data.py`: Generates the in-house dataset based on classical music notes and human reaction to sound.

### Preprocessing

*   `src/preprocessing/01_preprocess_text.py`: Preprocesses the text data from PubMed and clinical trials.
*   `src/preprocessing/02_preprocess_inhouse_data.R`: Preprocesses the in-house dataset.

### Modeling

*   `src/modeling/01_train_inhouse_model.py`: Trains the machine learning model on the in-house data.

### Analysis

*   `src/analysis/01_search_public_research.py`: Searches the public research data based on the in-house model's findings.
*   `src/analysis/02_comparative_analysis.R`: Performs a comparative analysis between the public research and the in-house model's results.
