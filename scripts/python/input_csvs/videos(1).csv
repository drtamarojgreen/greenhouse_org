JtzlAKDdUd4,169000,People,"Racial identity is a fundamental aspect of who we are, influencing our self-perception, relationships, and interactions with the world. However, the journey to understand and embrace this identity can often be fraught with challenges, confusion, and pain. Therapy offers a safe and supportive space to explore these complexities, helping individuals unpack their feelings, navigate cultural tensions, and develop resilience against discrimination. In both individual and group settings, therapy fosters a sense of community and validation, empowering individuals to celebrate their heritage and strengthen their self-acceptance. If you or someone you know is struggling with racial identity, consider reaching out to a licensed therapist to begin your journey towards healing, understanding, and living authentically.
