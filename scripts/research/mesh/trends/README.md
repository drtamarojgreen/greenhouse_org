# MeSH Trends Discovery Pipeline (Neural Version)

This pipeline uses a NumPy-based Neural Network (Autoencoder) and Clustering to discover trends in mental health MeSH terms.

## Key Features
- Neural Network Embedding (Autoencoder)
- K-Means Clustering
- Growth Modeling (Logistic Curve Fitting)
- Neural Classification (MLP)

## Usage
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --config config/pipeline.yaml
```
