# MeSH Historical Analysis - Data Results Summary

This directory contains the consolidated results from the MeSH discovery pipelines (both PCA-based and Neural-based) executed on real data samples.

## 📊 Results Explanation

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `curated_terms.csv` | A mapping of MeSH Unique Identifiers (UIs) to their human-readable names for terms selected during the 'discovery' phase. |
| `discovery_stats.csv` | Preliminary metrics (total count, active years, recent slope) and significance scores for terms scanned during the discovery mode. |
| `full_time_series.csv` | The raw longitudinal data (UI, Year, Count) for the curated set of terms. |
| `modeling_results.csv` | Initial growth model fits (Linear vs Logistic) and their basic parameters from the ingestion layer. |
| `pca_cluster_assignments.csv` | Mapping of every term to one of the temporal trajectory clusters discovered via **PCA** embeddings. |
| `pca_mental_health_clusters.csv` | Aggregated statistics for the specific clusters identified as "mental health growth" profiles in the PCA pipeline. |
| `pca_top_terms_by_year.csv` | The most frequent terms within target growth clusters for every year in the analysis, based on PCA clustering. **Note**: Counts in this file are log-normalized ($ln(1+x)$). |
| `neural_classification_results.csv` | Probabilities generated by the **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** classifying terms into "High Growth" vs "Other" categories. |
| `neural_cluster_assignments.csv` | Mapping of every term to trajectory clusters discovered via **Neural Autoencoder** embeddings. |
| `neural_mental_health_clusters.csv` | Aggregated statistics for growth-profile clusters discovered in the Neural pipeline. |
| `neural_growth_models.csv` | Precise logistic growth parameters ($L$, $k$, $x_0$) for terms in the target clusters, quantifying growth rate and inflection points. |
| `neural_top_terms_by_year.csv` | The most frequent terms within target growth clusters for every year, based on Neural clustering. **Note**: Counts in this file are log-normalized ($ln(1+x)$). |

## 📅 Why do the records stop at 1989?

The data currently present in these results was generated using the **initial files of the 2025 PubMed Baseline** (`pubmed25n0001.xml.gz` and `pubmed25n0002.xml.gz`).

PubMed baseline files are distributed according to their PubMed Identifiers (PMIDs). Since PMIDs are assigned sequentially as articles are indexed, the earliest files in the baseline contain the oldest records.
- File **0001** contains the very first indexed articles, starting from the mid-19th century and 1940s/50s.
- File **0002** continues this sequence into the late **1980s**.

To analyze data up to 2024/2025, the pipeline would need to process subsequent files in the baseline (0003 through ~1300+). The current sample demonstrates the functional pipeline logic using the first two volumes of global medical research history.
