# Computational Requirements for Functional Brain Modeling

This document outlines the estimated computational requirements for storing and analyzing large-scale brain connectome data, based on the analysis of the fly hemibrain and human brain datasets.

## Storage Requirements

*   **Fly Hemibrain Connectome:** The full hemibrain dataset, as described in the prompt, is on the order of 100s of gigabytes. The synapse-level prediction file alone is ~450MB. A full functional model including stimuli and behavioral data would likely require several terabytes of storage.
*   **Human Brain Data:** The human connectome project that generated 1.4 petabytes of data for a cubic millimeter of brain tissue demonstrates the immense storage requirements for high-resolution human brain mapping. Modeling a whole human brain, with its 86 billion neurons, would require exabytes of storage.

## Memory Requirements

*   **Analysis:** In-memory analysis of even subsets of these datasets requires significant RAM. The 29MB `supplemental_data_4.csv` file from the fly connectome is manageable on a personal computer, but the full datasets are not. A distributed computing environment with a large shared memory pool would be necessary for any meaningful analysis.
*   **Modeling:** Functional brain simulation is extremely memory-intensive. The state of each neuron and synapse needs to be stored in memory, and the connections between them need to be efficiently accessed. This would require a supercomputing cluster with terabytes or even petabytes of RAM.

## Processing Requirements

*   **Parallel Processing:** The nature of brain data, with its billions of individual components, lends itself well to parallel processing. A distributed computing framework like Spark is essential for performing computations on this data in a reasonable amount of time.
*   **Specialized Hardware:** While not strictly necessary for all tasks, specialized hardware like GPUs can significantly accelerate certain computations, particularly those involving machine learning and deep learning models for tasks like neuron segmentation and neurotransmitter prediction.

## Proposed Environment for a Personal Computer

Given the scale of the data, a full analysis on a personal computer is not feasible. However, a small-scale demonstration of the analysis pipeline can be set up using containerization and a small subset of the data. The following tools can be used to create a simulated distributed environment:

*   **Hadoop:** For distributed storage (HDFS) and processing (MapReduce).
*   **Spark:** For in-memory parallel processing, which is much faster than MapReduce for many applications.
*   **MySQL:** For storing structured metadata and query results.
*   **Parquet:** A columnar storage format that is highly efficient for analytical querying.

The `setup_environment.sh` script provides a conceptual demonstration of how these tools could be installed and used to partition a large connectome database for analysis.
