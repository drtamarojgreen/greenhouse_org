# This script provides a conceptual demonstration of how to set up a distributed
# computing environment for analyzing large-scale connectome data.
# It is not intended to be run directly, as it requires a multi-node cluster
# and significant system resources.

# --- 1. Install Dependencies ---
# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install Java (required for Hadoop and Spark)
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk

# Install MySQL Server
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server

# --- 2. Install and Configure Hadoop ---
# Download and extract Hadoop
wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.1/hadoop-3.3.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf hadoop-3.3.1.tar.gz
sudo mv hadoop-3.3.1 /usr/local/hadoop

# Configure Hadoop environment variables
echo "export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$HADOOP_HOME/bin:\$HADOOP_HOME/sbin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Configure Hadoop (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml, yarn-site.xml)
# This would involve specifying the locations of the namenode and datanodes,
# as well as other cluster-specific configurations.

# Format the HDFS filesystem
hdfs namenode -format

# Start Hadoop services
start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh


# --- 3. Install and Configure Spark ---
# Download and extract Spark
wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.2.1/spark-3.2.1-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz
tar -xvf spark-3.2.1-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz
sudo mv spark-3.2.1-bin-hadoop3.2 /usr/local/spark

# Configure Spark environment variables
echo "export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$SPARK_HOME/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Configure Spark to use the Hadoop cluster
# This would involve setting the SPARK_MASTER_HOST and other properties.


# --- 4. Install Parquet tools ---
# Parquet is a file format, not a standalone tool. It is supported by Spark and Hadoop.
# The necessary libraries are included with Spark.
# One might install tools for viewing parquet files:
# pip install pyarrow pandas
# pip install parquet-cli


# --- 5. Database Partitioning Demonstration ---
echo "--- Conceptual Demonstration of Database Partitioning ---"

# Assume a large connectome CSV file named 'connectome.csv'
# This file would be too large to fit on a single machine.

# 1. Split the large CSV into smaller chunks
split -l 1000000 connectome.csv connectome_chunk_

# 2. Upload the chunks to HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /connectome_data
hdfs dfs -put connectome_chunk_* /connectome_data

# 3. Create a Spark script to process the data
# This script would read the CSV files from HDFS, process them,
# and save the results in Parquet format.

# Example Spark script (conceptual):
# from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
# spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Connectome").getOrCreate()
# df = spark.read.csv("hdfs:///connectome_data/connectome_chunk_*")
# df.write.parquet("hdfs:///connectome_parquet")

echo "Environment setup conceptually complete."
