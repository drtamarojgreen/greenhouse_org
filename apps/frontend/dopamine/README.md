# Dopamine Signaling Simulation

This application provides an interactive visualization of dopamine signaling in the striatum.

## Features
- Coupling of striatal neurons in the signaling complex for D1R receptors to adenylyl cyclase 5.
- Substitution of GDP and GTP.
- Visualization of D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 receptors.
- Release of secondary messengers: cAMP.
- Involvement of ATP, AC, DAG, and PLC with ion products.
- Inclusion of PKA and CAMKII.
