# Cognition Simulation

This directory contains the frontend code for the **Cognition Simulation** page.

---

## How it works

The `Cognition.js` file serves as a placeholder for the Velo/React component logic. It is responsible for defining the interface and providing instructions for loading the external Greenhouse application loader.

### Key Features:

-   **External Integration**: Designed to work with a Custom Element or an iframe that points to the cognition simulation assets.
-   **Loader Initialization**: Intended to trigger the Greenhouse application loader.

### Implementation Notes:

-   Requires a container with ID `cognition-app-container` if using direct script injection.
-   Can be integrated using an HTML Element pointing to `cognition.html`.
