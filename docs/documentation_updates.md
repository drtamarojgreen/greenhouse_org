# Summary of Documentation Updates

This document summarizes the recent updates made to the repository's documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

### 1. `docs/app_testing_guide.md`

-   **Change:** Complete rewrite.
-   **Reason:** The previous guide was obsolete, describing a testing structure and methodology that is no longer in use.
-   **Summary:** The new guide provides a high-level overview of the current, multi-faceted testing strategy. It covers the three distinct testing frameworks now present in the repository: the legacy Python/Selenium suite, the modern structured Python framework, and the new JavaScript-based integration test suite.

### 2. `docs/current_refactor_status.md`

-   **Change:** Updated to reflect the incomplete status of the refactoring effort.
-   **Reason:** The document described a planned refactoring of UI logic that was only partially implemented.
-   **Summary:** The updated document now accurately states that while the initial, static UI *creation* has been moved to `schedulerUI.js`, the dynamic UI *manipulation* logic (e.g., rendering calendar days, showing modals) remains within the application-specific files like `GreenhousePatientApp.js`. It clarifies what work has been done and what remains.

### 3. `docs/dependency_loading_analysis.md`

-   **Change:** Rewritten to serve as a historical record of a completed architectural decision.
-   **Reason:** The original document was a forward-looking analysis proposing solutions for a problem that had already been solved with the implementation of `GreenhouseDependencyManager.js`.
-   **Summary:** The document now explains that the promise-based dependency manager was the chosen solution. It provides a high-level overview of the manager's features and benefits and points to `docs/js/GreenhouseDependencyManager.js` as the canonical implementation.

### 4. `docs/firefox_react_compatability_guide.md`

-   **Change:** Created a new document.
-   **Reason:** The file was missing, creating a documentation gap for the existing `GreenhouseReactCompatibility.js` script.
-   **Summary:** The new guide explains the critical problem of DOM manipulation conflicts between vanilla JavaScript and the React-based Wix environment, particularly in Firefox. It instructs developers on how to use the "safe" functions provided by the compatibility layer (e.g., `createElementSafely`, `insertElementSafely`) to prevent runtime errors and UI glitches.

### 5. Status of Other Documentation

The remaining documentation files listed in the request were also reviewed. These files are primarily strategic, planning, or high-level design documents (e.g., `plan.md`, `infrastructure_outline.md`, `wix_backend_plan.md`).

A code-level analysis of the repository did not provide sufficient information to warrant updates to these strategic documents. Their content is not directly verifiable against the current implementation without further strategic context or product-level decisions, which are outside the scope of this technical documentation update. Therefore, they have been left unchanged.
