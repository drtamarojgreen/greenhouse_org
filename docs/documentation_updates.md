# Summary of Documentation Updates

This document summarizes the recent updates made to the repository's documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

### 1. `docs/app_testing_guide.md`

-   **Change:** Complete rewrite.
-   **Reason:** The previous guide was obsolete, describing a testing structure and methodology that is no longer in use.
-   **Summary:** The new guide provides a high-level overview of the current, multi-faceted testing strategy. It covers the three distinct testing frameworks now present in the repository: the legacy Python/Selenium suite, the modern structured Python framework, and the new JavaScript-based integration test suite.

### 2. `docs/current_refactor_status.md`

-   **Change:** Updated to reflect the incomplete status of the refactoring effort.
-   **Reason:** The document described a planned refactoring of UI logic that was only partially implemented.
-   **Summary:** The updated document now accurately states that while the initial, static UI *creation* has been moved to `schedulerUI.js`, the dynamic UI *manipulation* logic (e.g., rendering calendar days, showing modals) remains within the application-specific files like `GreenhousePatientApp.js`. It clarifies what work has been done and what remains.

### 3. `docs/dependency_loading_analysis.md`

-   **Change:** Rewritten to serve as a historical record of a completed architectural decision.
-   **Reason:** The original document was a forward-looking analysis proposing solutions for a problem that had already been solved with the implementation of `GreenhouseDependencyManager.js`.
-   **Summary:** The document now explains that the promise-based dependency manager was the chosen solution. It provides a high-level overview of the manager's features and benefits and points to `docs/js/GreenhouseDependencyManager.js` as the canonical implementation.

### 4. `docs/firefox_react_compatability_guide.md`

-   **Change:** Created a new document.
-   **Reason:** The file was missing, creating a documentation gap for the existing `GreenhouseReactCompatibility.js` script.
-   **Summary:** The new guide explains the critical problem of DOM manipulation conflicts between vanilla JavaScript and the React-based Wix environment, particularly in Firefox. It instructs developers on how to use the "safe" functions provided by the compatibility layer (e.g., `createElementSafely`, `insertElementSafely`) to prevent runtime errors and UI glitches.

### 5. Detailed Scheduler Documentation Review

A deep dive into all scheduler-related documentation was conducted. Most of these documents were found to be severely outdated, describing aspirational plans rather than the implemented reality. They have been rewritten to serve as accurate "as-built" documentation.

-   **`docs/scheduler-ui-recommendations.md`**: Rewritten as an "Archived" document, confirming that the recommendation to remove a fetch button was completed.
-   **`docs/scheduler_current_status.md`**: Rewritten as a current technical status report, clarifying persistent bugs (like the admin view race condition) and their architectural root causes.
-   **`docs/scheduler_design_plan.md`**: Completely rewritten to document the *actual* implemented design (a simple, single-form patient view) and to remove the inaccurate description of a multi-step, therapist-selection flow.
-   **`docs/scheduler_development_plan.md`**: Completely rewritten to provide an "as-built" summary of the development process that *actually occurred*, replacing the previous fictitious plan.
-   **`docs/scheduler_enhancements.md`**: Rewritten from a sprawling, irrelevant wishlist into a concise, realistic roadmap of enhancements that can be built upon the *current* application.
-   **`docs/scheduler_implementation_plan.md`**: Rewritten to accurately describe the implemented architecture, where the embedded `scheduler.js` is the primary controller, correcting the previous document which described an unimplemented Velo-centric model.
-   **`docs/scheduler_permissions_implementation_summary.md`**: Rewritten to accurately reflect the "Incomplete" status of the security refactor, clarifying that new secure endpoints were created but never fully integrated.
-   **`docs/scheduler_security_implementation.md`**: Rewritten as an "as-built" security analysis, highlighting the current insecure "default-to-patient" state and the urgent need to complete the planned RBAC refactoring.
-   **`docs/scheduler_view_issues.md`**: Updated to reflect the current "Unresolved" status of the admin view loading bug, explaining why an attempted fix was insufficient.
-   **`docs/schedule_app_design_plan.md`**: Completely rewritten to remove dangerously misleading information about a React/Node.js-based application, replacing it with the correct as-built design of the Velo/Static JS application.
