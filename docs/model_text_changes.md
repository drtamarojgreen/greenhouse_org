# Documentation of Text Changes in `model.js`

This document provides a specific, detailed record of the user-facing text and instructional changes that were implemented in the `docs/js/models.js` file. These modifications were made to enhance the clarity and user experience of the simulation interface.

## 1. Top Banner Text Modification

The top banner displayed within the main simulation interface was updated to provide a more concise and accurate description of the model.

-   **Location:** The change was made within the `renderSimulationInterface` function.
-   **Original Text:** "For Educational Purposes: This model simulates conceptual brain activity."
-   **New Text:** "Cognitive model prototype"

This change was implemented by modifying the string passed to the `createElement` function for the `topBanner` variable:

```javascript
const topBanner = this.createElement('div', { className: 'greenhouse-disclaimer-banner' }, 'Cognitive model prototype');
```

## 2. Expansion of "How to Use" Instructions

The "How to Use" section of the simulation's control panel was significantly expanded to provide users with clear, actionable instructions for each of the model's controls. The original placeholder paragraph was replaced with a detailed, unordered list.

-   **Location:** The change was made within the `populateControlsPanel` function.
-   **Original HTML:**
    ```html
    <h3 class="greenhouse-panel-title">How to Use</h3>
    <p>Use the controls to see how different parameters affect the strength of neural connections in real-time.</p>
    ```
-   **New HTML:**
    ```html
    <h3 class="greenhouse-panel-title">How to Use</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Practice Intensity:</strong> Adjusts the strength of the simulated therapeutic practice. Higher intensity leads to faster changes in synaptic weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulation Speed:</strong> Controls the speed of the animation.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization Mode:</strong> Switch between a 'Synaptic Close-up' and a 'Network Overview'.</li>
        <li><strong>Play/Pause:</strong> Starts or stops the simulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset Plasticity:</strong> Resets the simulation to its initial state.</li>
    </ul>
    ```

This modification provides users with a much clearer understanding of how to interact with the simulation and what to expect from each control.
