- Spanish translations (human-verified).

### Content governance
- **Editorial calendar (2 articles/month):** Topics: sleep hygiene, teen therapy, ADHD supports, how medication management works, coping with anxiety.
- **Style guide:** (inclusive language, reading level ~8th grade).

- **i18n:** next-intl or next-i18next with translated slugs.

### Performance budget
- Images via next/image + CDN; lazy-load below the fold.
- Third-party scripts kept to an absolute minimum; defer and use consent gating.

## Next Practical Step

1.  **Pick CMS** (Sanity vs WordPress headless) and **booking vendor** (EHR-native if possible).
2.  I’ll then produce:
    - Mobile-first wireframes for the 5 key flows.
    - Copy deck templates (EN/ES) for Home, Services, Fees, Telehealth.
    - A development plan with tasks broken into tickets (GitHub/Jira).
