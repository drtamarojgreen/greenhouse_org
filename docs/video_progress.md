# Video Page Display Progress

**Date:** September 8, 2025

**Objective:** Ensure the videos page (`https://www.greenhousementalhealth.org/videos/`) displays video content using a DOM structure consistent with the books and news pages, specifically leveraging the Wix repeater object pattern.

---

## Current Status:

Significant progress has been made in aligning the video page's DOM structure with the desired repeater pattern. The `docs/js/videos.js` script has been updated to dynamically generate video elements that conform to the Wix repeater layout. The main loader script (`docs/js/greenhouse.js`) has also been configured to correctly target the Wix repeater container for the videos application.

## Key Changes Implemented:

1.  **`docs/js/videos.js` Modifications:**
    *   **`displayVideos` Function:** This function was refactored to generate HTML for each video item that precisely matches the structure of a Wix repeater item. This includes specific class names (`T7n0L6`, `comp-mf8yayls`, `wixui-repeater__item`, etc.), IDs (`comp-mf8yayls__item-${index}`), and data attributes (`data-hook`, `data-motion-part`, `data-testid`).
    *   **Video Embedding:** Within the new repeater item structure, an `iframe` element is used to embed the video, replacing the previous image-based approach.
    *   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
        *   A `hasCriticalError` flag was introduced in `appState` to prevent re-initialization attempts if a critical error (e.g., 404 from API) occurs.
        *   An `observeVideosListElement` function was added to monitor the `#videos-list` container. If this element is removed from the DOM (a common occurrence in dynamic Wix environments), the application will attempt to re-render, improving robustness.
        *   The `main` function's re-initialization logic was updated to check both `appState.hasCriticalError` and `appState.isLoading` to prevent redundant or problematic re-initialization cycles.

2.  **`docs/js/greenhouse.js` Modifications:**
    *   **Selector Update:** The `config.selectors.videos` entry was updated to `.wixui-repeater`. This ensures that the `greenhouse.js` loader correctly identifies the target container for injecting the videos application, matching the structure used by other dynamic content sections.

## Pending Issues / Next Steps:

1.  **`docs/js/books.js` Consistency:** An attempt to update the `findOptimalContainer` function in `docs/js/books.js` to also use the `.wixui-repeater` selector resulted in TypeScript errors. This needs to be corrected to ensure all dynamic content applications (`books`, `news`, `videos`) use a consistent and robust method for DOM insertion.
2.  **Testing:** Thorough testing of the videos page on the live Wix site is required to confirm that the changes correctly display the video shorts and that the application behaves as expected under various conditions (e.g., initial load, navigation, API errors).
