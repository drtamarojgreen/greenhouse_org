# Scheduler Permissions Backend: Implementation Status

**Status: Incomplete**

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the current status of the implementation of a secure, role-based permissions system for the scheduler backend. The implementation was started but was **not completed**.

While new, secure versions of several key backend functions were created, the original, less secure functions remain in the codebase, and the frontend has not been fully migrated to use the new endpoints.

## 2. Work Completed

A partial security refactor was performed, resulting in the creation of several new, secure web modules. These modules serve as a good foundation but are not yet fully integrated.

### Files Created/Modified:

*   `apps/wv/backend/permissions.web.js`: A centralized module for checking user roles (e.g., `isCurrentUserAdmin`). This module is well-implemented and can be used as a shared utility.
*   `apps/wv/backend/createAppointmentSecure.web.js`: **(Partial Implementation)** Contains secure versions of `createAppointment`, `updateAppointment`, and `cancelAppointment`. These functions correctly check user roles, prevent users from modifying others' appointments, and include audit logging.
*   `apps/wv/backend/getAppointmentsSecure.web.js`: **(Partial Implementation)** A new module for securely fetching appointment data, with logic to filter the data based on the user's role.
*   `apps/wv/backend/resolveConflictSecure.web.js`: **(Partial Implementation)** A secure version of the conflict resolution function, correctly restricted to administrators.

## 3. Key Discrepancies and Incomplete Work

The previous summary of this work was inaccurate and premature. The following critical gaps remain:

1.  **Old Endpoints Still Exist:** The original, insecure backend functions (e.g., `createAppointment.web.js`, `getAppointments.web.js`) were never removed. They still exist alongside the new "Secure" versions, creating a significant security risk if they are still being called by any part of the application.
2.  **Frontend Not Migrated:** The frontend application (`apps/frontend/schedule/Schedule.js` and the static JS files) has **not** been updated to exclusively call the new, secure endpoints. It still references and calls the original, insecure functions.
3.  **No Test Suite:** The claim of a `test/test_scheduler_permissions.py` test suite with "7/7 tests passed" is **false**. No such test suite exists in the repository. The security of the new functions has not been formally verified.
4.  **Incomplete Feature Set:** The "Secure" modules do not cover all the functionality of the original modules. The refactoring appears to have been abandoned midway through.

## 4. Current Security Posture

The application's security is **vulnerable**. Because both the old and new endpoints exist, and the frontend has not been fully migrated, it is highly likely that insecure backend functions are still in use.

The implemented security model in the `*Secure.web.js` files is sound, but it is not being consistently enforced across the application.

## 5. Next Steps (Action Plan)

To complete the security refactoring, the following steps are required:

1.  **Full Backend Implementation:** Review all original backend functions and ensure that a "Secure" equivalent exists for each one. Complete any missing implementations.
2.  **Frontend Migration:** Scour the entire frontend codebase (`apps/frontend/schedule/Schedule.js` and all `docs/js/*.js` files) and replace every call to an old backend function with a call to its new, secure equivalent.
3.  **Deprecate Old Endpoints:** Once the frontend migration is complete and verified, the original backend files (`createAppointment.web.js`, etc.) must be **deleted** to ensure they can no longer be called.
4.  **Create a Test Suite:** A proper test suite must be created to validate the permissions logic, confirming that non-admins cannot access admin data or perform restricted actions.
