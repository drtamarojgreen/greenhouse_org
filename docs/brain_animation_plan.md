# Brain Animation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating animated videos for the `models/genetic` and `models/neuro` pages.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create engaging videos that showcase the functionality of the genetic and neuro models. These videos will be used on the website to provide a visual demonstration of the models' capabilities.

## Video Production Workflow

### Setup

The animations for both the genetic and neuro models are loaded from external sources. To record the animations, you will need to run the applications in a browser.

*   **Genetic Model:** The application is loaded from an external script. To view and record the animation, navigate to the page that embeds the `#genetic-app-container` and runs the `initGeneticSimulation` function.
*   **Neuro Model:** The application is loaded from an external URL. To view and record the animation, navigate to the page that embeds the neuro application, likely from a URL similar to `https://drtamarojgreen.github.io/greenhouse_org/neuro.html`.

### Screen Recording

*   **Tools:** Use a screen recording tool such as OBS Studio, QuickTime, or a browser extension.
*   **Settings:** Record at a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080) and 30fps.

### Editing

*   **Software:** Use a video editing tool such as DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or iMovie.
*   **Guidelines:**
    *   Trim the beginning and end of the recording to remove any unnecessary footage.
    *   Add a title card with the name of the model.
    *   Add background music.
    *   Add annotations to explain what is happening in the animation.

### Final Output

*   **Format:** MP4
*   **Resolution:** 1080p (1920x1080)

## Video Content Guidelines

### Genetic Model Video

*   Show the initial state of the population.
*   Show the evolution process, including selection, crossover, and mutation.
*   Show the final result, where the population has converged on a solution.

### Neuro Model Video

*   Show the initial state of the neural network.
*   Show the learning process, where the network is trained on a dataset.
*   Show the final state, where the network is able to make accurate predictions.
