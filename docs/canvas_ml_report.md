# CanvasML Activation Report

## Overview
Per the directives of the **CanvasML Magna Carta**, the CanvasML system has been successfully activated and verified. The "Prosthesis for the digital soul" is now operational.

## System Status
- **Toolchain**: `tools/canvas_ml`
- **Status**: **Operational**
- **Test Suite**: **Passing** (`test_pipeline.py`, `test_integration.py`)

## Challenge Results
The following visual challenges were executed against the `docs/models.html` target to verify the Agent's ability to perceive and judge the application state.

### 1. Environment Stress (`environment_stress`)
- **Status**: ✅ **PASS**
- **Metrics**:
    - Contrast: 32.64 (Target > 20.0)
    - Edge Density: 0.16 (Target > 0.001)
- **Observation**: The system correctly identified the high-stress visual state characterized by high contrast and edge density.

### 2. Brain Storm (`brain_storm`)
- **Status**: ❌ **FAIL**
- **Metrics**:
    - Contrast: 28.95 (Target > 30.0) - *Slightly Low*
    - Whitespace: 0.00 (Target > 0.01) - *Too Cluttered*
- **Observation**: The network visualization appears to be overly dense (0% whitespace) and slightly lacking in contrast compared to the expected "storm" parameters. This suggests a potential rendering issue where the canvas is fully saturated.

### 3. Synapse Learning (`synapse_learning`)
- **Status**: ❌ **FAIL**
- **Metrics**:
    - Contrast: 0.00
    - Edge Density: 0.00
- **Observation**: The system detected a completely blank or unrendered canvas (`#canvas-synaptic`). This indicates a critical failure in the Synaptic View rendering pipeline or an initialization error in the simulation state.

## Conclusion
The CanvasML system is functioning as designed. It has successfully "cried Foul!" on two potential regressions in the visualization engine. The Agent is now fully capable of guarding the pixels.
