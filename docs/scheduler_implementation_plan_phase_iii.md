| Category                       | Key Requirements                                                                 | Challenges                                           | Solution Directions                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduling Aggregation**     | Aggregate, display, and manage appointments from multiple external platforms.      | Disparate APIs, data models, and sync logic.         | Backend modules for API integration & data normalization. |
| **Admin Calendar Management**  | Allow admin editing of therapist calendars; filter by clinician, office, source. | Permissions, real-time updates, scalability.         | Role-based access; UI data binding; webhooks for refresh. |
| **Google Calendar Sync**       | Two-way appointment sync; display "busy" blocks from external Google accounts.   | OAuth2 delegation, bidirectional syncing, conflicts. | Google API integration, token rotation, conflict logic.   |
| **Real-Time Conflict Detection** | Dynamically detect and warn on double-bookings and calendar conflicts.           | Complex detection logic, UI alerts, concurrency.     | Backend event queue, scheduling algorithms, live UI cues. |
| **Role-Based Access Control**  | Differentiate between admins, therapists, and front desk with restricted views.  | Secure access, permission enforcement, scalability.  | Utilize Wix roles, restrict backend APIs, field-level security. |
| **Secure Health Data Handling**| Ensure all data flows and storage are HIPAA-compliant.                            | Technical and legal limitations of the Wix platform. | PHI segmentation, externalized storage, encryption.       |
| **Audit & Error Reporting**    | Log all changes, data access, and errors for administrative review.              | Real-time, persistent, and secure logging.           | Backend logging modules, Site Monitoring, and alerts.     |
| **Performance and Uptime**     | Ensure rapid UI updates and robustness against outages and high-frequency use.    | Cache consistency, API throttling, error recovery.   | Caching strategies, rate limits, optimistic UI updates.   |
| **Extensibility**              | Design for future integration with new EMR/EHR systems and analytics.            | Flexible schema, API abstraction, event bus.         | Modular backend, schema versioning, event-driven design.  |
