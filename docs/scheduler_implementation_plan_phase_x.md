# Wix Velo Scheduler: Implementation Plan - Phase X: Testing and Quality Assurance Strategy

A multi-layered testing strategy will be implemented to ensure correctness, reliability, and regression prevention.

### 10.1. Unit Testing

-   **Framework:** Jest (run locally in a Node.js environment).
-   **Scope:** Backend modules (`.jsw` files) will be tested in isolation.
-   **Critical Test Targets:**
    -   `dataNormalization.jsw`: Test all transformer functions (e.g., `normalizeZocdocAppointment`) with mock API responses to ensure they produce the correct canonical object.
    -   `conflictDetection.jsw`: Test the `detectConflicts` function with various scenarios (direct overlaps, boundary conditions, time-off blocks).
    -   `permissions.jsw`: Test the logic that checks user roles and grants/denies access to actions.

### 10.2. Integration Testing

-   **Framework:** Velo's built-in backend testing capabilities.
-   **Scope:** Verify the interaction between different backend components.
-   **Priority Scenarios:**
    -   **API to Data:** Ensure that after a successful external API call, the transformed data is correctly inserted into the `Appointments` Wix Data Collection.
    -   **Permissions:** Test that a backend function correctly rejects a call from a user with insufficient permissions.
    -   **Cache Logic:** Verify that the caching module correctly stores and retrieves data, and that cache misses trigger a real API call.

### 10.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

-   **Framework:** Puppeteer or Playwright.
-   **Scope:** Simulate full user journeys in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors production.
-   **Critical User Journeys to Automate:**
    1.  **Admin Conflict Resolution:** Log in as admin -> view calendar -> identify a conflict -> click the conflict -> choose a resolution -> verify the calendar updates correctly.
    2.  **Therapist Google Sync:** Log in as therapist -> initiate Google Calendar sync -> complete OAuth flow -> verify that a new appointment created in the system appears on their Google Calendar.
    3.  **Basic Appointment Creation:** (As Admin) Create a new appointment -> verify it appears on the calendar with the correct details and no conflicts.

### 10.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

-   **Framework:** A structured plan with defined scenarios and roles.
-   **Participants:** A select group of administrators and therapists.
-   **Process:**
    1.  Provide participants with a list of tasks to perform (e.g., "Schedule a follow-up for a patient," "Resolve the two conflicting appointments for Dr. Smith").
    2.  Participants will execute the tasks and report any bugs, usability issues, or confusing workflows via a feedback form.
    3.  The development team will address the feedback before the final production release.
