# Summary of Project Progress (Aug 29 - Sep 11, 2025)

This document provides a summary of the development activities based on the commit history from late August to early September 2025.

## Key Development Themes

### 1. Cross-Browser Compatibility & Performance
A major effort was undertaken to identify and resolve cross-browser compatibility issues, ensuring a consistent user experience on browsers like Safari and Firefox.
- **Planning & Bug Fixes (PR #20, #23):** A comprehensive plan was documented in `docs/cross_browser_issues.md`. Key fixes included:
    - Correcting a `querySelectors` typo in JavaScript.
    - Adding vendor prefixes (`-webkit-`) and fallbacks for modern CSS properties like `backdrop-filter`.
    - Fixing CSS property order for text gradients to ensure fallbacks work correctly.
- **Performance Enhancements (PR #14):** JavaScript animations were refactored to use `requestAnimationFrame` instead of forced reflows, resulting in smoother and more performant visual effects.

### 2. Interactive Appointment Scheduler
The appointment scheduler evolved from a static display into a full-stack, interactive application.
- **Full-Stack Implementation (PR #16):** A complete booking workflow was implemented using Velo for the frontend and backend, including a data schema for Wix Collections.
- **Full CRUD Functionality (PR #2):** The scheduler was enhanced with full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities, allowing users to edit and delete their appointments.
- **Conflict Resolution (PR #2, #3):** The backend logic was improved to intelligently check for scheduling conflicts. The UI was updated to display conflicts in a user-friendly modal dialog.
- **Numerous UI/UX updates:** The scheduler's CSS and JavaScript received frequent updates to improve its look and feel.

### 3. Velo Platform Integration
The project moved towards a more robust backend by leveraging the Velo platform.
- **Frontend Refactoring (PR #15):** The `books`, `inspiration`, `news`, `schedule`, and `videos` components were refactored to fetch data using Velo backend code, replacing previous client-side JavaScript implementations.
- **Native Module Porting (PR #4):** Backend logic was ported to Velo backend modules (`.jsw` files) to centralize data management.

### 4. New Features & Visual Effects
Several new user-facing features and visual effects were added to enhance the site's appeal.
- **Vine Effect (PR #8, #12):** A standalone "vine growth" animation was created for the main site title.
- **Watering Can Effect:** An interactive effect where a watering can icon follows the cursor was implemented.
- **Books Page:** A new page for books was added and updated.

### 5. Extensive Documentation
Significant work was done to create and improve project documentation.
- **Developer Guides:** New guides were created for the developer toolkit (`docs/greenhouse_it_tools.md`), UI styling (`docs/greenhouse_style_guide.md`), and backend testing (`docs/backend_testing.md`).
- **Feature Documentation:** Detailed plans and API flows were documented for major features like the scheduler design, conflict resolution, and cross-browser compatibility.
- **Code Documentation:** READMEs and code comments were updated across the repository to reflect the new Velo-based architecture.

### 6. General Housekeeping
- **Unit Tests:** Initial unit tests were added.
- **Dependency Management:** The scheduler's backend was refactored to remove the Express.js dependency and use Node.js's native `http` module (PR #5).
