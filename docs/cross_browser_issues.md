# Cross-Browser Compatibility Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for identifying, resolving, and preventing cross-browser compatibility issues on the Greenhouse for Mental Health Development website and associated applications.

## 1. Browser Support Matrix

The following table defines the browsers and devices that our web applications will officially support. Testing will be prioritized to ensure functionality and visual consistency across these targets.

| Category      | Browser           | Versions Supported      | Operating System |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Desktop**   | Google Chrome     | Latest 2 major versions | Windows, macOS   |
|               | Mozilla Firefox   | Latest 2 major versions | Windows, macOS   |
|               | Apple Safari      | Latest 2 major versions | macOS            |
|               | Microsoft Edge    | Latest 2 major versions | Windows          |
| **Mobile**    | Safari on iOS     | Latest major version    | iOS              |
|               | Chrome on Android | Latest major version    | Android          |

## 2. Critical Testing Areas & User Flows

Testing will be focused on the following key pages, applications, and features, as they are critical to the user experience and business operations.

### Core Website Pages
- Homepage
- About Us
- Services Overview
- Contact Page & Forms

### Key Applications
- **Appointment Scheduler**: The entire flow from selecting a service to confirming an appointment. This is the highest priority application.
- **Content Applications**: Verification that the following apps render correctly:
  - Books (`apps/frontend/books`)
  - News (`apps/frontend/news`)
  - Videos (`apps/frontend/videos`)
  - Inspiration (`apps/frontend/inspiration`)

### High-Risk Features
- **Custom Animations & Effects**:
  - `vine-effect`
  - `watering-can-effect`
  - Any other "calming animations" or CSS transitions.
- **Dynamic Content**: Components that load data from the backend (e.g., lists of services, news articles, video feeds).
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Any embedded widgets or services.

## 3. Manual Testing Strategy

The following checklist should be used to perform manual, exploratory testing across all browsers defined in the support matrix. The goal is to identify visual bugs, functional errors, and performance issues.

### General Site-Wide Checks
- [ ] **Layout & Alignment**: Do all pages render without broken layouts? Are elements aligned correctly?
- [ ] **Font Rendering**: Are the custom fonts (`Quicksand`, `Segoe UI`) loading and rendering correctly? Is the text legible?
- [ ] **Image & Media Display**: Are all images and videos visible and correctly proportioned?
- [ ] **Responsiveness**: Resize the browser window from narrow to wide. Do all elements reflow and adapt correctly? Check on both desktop and mobile viewports.
- [ ] **Navigation**: Do all links in the main navigation and footer work correctly?

### High-Risk Feature Testing
- [ ] **Gradient Text & Effects**: Verify that all text with gradient effects (`background-clip: text`) is displayed correctly. Is there a readable fallback color if the gradient fails?
- [ ] **Animations & Transitions**: Trigger all animations and transitions. Are they smooth and free of "jank"?
  - [ ] Test the "grow" animation on the main page title.
  - [ ] Test the "bounce" and "shimmer" effects.
  - [ ] Test the "sunlight-flare" effect on headings.
- [ ] **`backdrop-filter` effects**: Check elements that use blurring effects. Is there a graceful fallback (e.g., a translucent background) on browsers that don't support it (like Firefox)?

### Interactive Effects Testing (requires button clicks)
- [ ] **Watering Can Effect**:
  - [ ] Activate the effect. Does the "ðŸª´" icon appear and follow the cursor smoothly?
  - [ ] Move the cursor over the target heading. Does the heading "bloom" and do water droplets appear?
  - [ ] Is the droplet animation smooth?
  - [ ] Deactivate the effect. Do all elements (icon, droplets) disappear cleanly?
- [ ] **Vine Effect**:
  - [ ] Activate the effect. Does the vine SVG draw smoothly around the heading?
  - [ ] Does the text fade in correctly?
  - [ ] Deactivate the effect. Does it reset to its original state properly?

### Critical Application: Appointment Scheduler
- [ ] **Service Selection**: Can you view and select different services?
- [ ] **Date & Time Picker**: Does the calendar/time selection widget display and function correctly?
- [- [ ] **Form Submission**: Can you successfully fill out and submit the appointment request form?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: If you submit the form with invalid data, are clear error messages displayed?

## 4. Recommended Testing Platforms

Manually testing on every combination of browser, OS, and device is impractical. We strongly recommend using a professional cross-browser testing platform to streamline this process.

**Recommended Service:** [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/)

**Why use a testing platform?**
- **Coverage**: Provides instant access to thousands of real desktop and mobile device environments.
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates the need to maintain a local device lab.
- **Debugging**: Includes built-in developer tools for inspecting and debugging issues directly within the remote environment.
- **Automation**: These platforms can be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline for automated testing in the future.

## 5. Known Issues and Action Plan

The following issues were identified during a static analysis of the codebase. They are prioritized based on their potential impact on user experience and browser compatibility.

| Priority | Issue Description | Affected File(s) | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | JS typo (`querySelectors` instead of `querySelectorAll`) will cause a runtime error and break the watering can effect. | `docs/js/watering-can-effect.js` | Fix the typo. |
| **High** | The `mousemove` event listener for the watering can effect updates the DOM directly, which is likely to cause animation stuttering ("jank") on some browsers. | `docs/js/watering-can-effect.js` | Refactor the event handler to use `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother DOM updates. |
| **High** | The CSS `backdrop-filter` property is used without the `-webkit-` prefix for Safari compatibility and lacks a visual fallback for unsupported browsers like Firefox. | `docs/css/style.css` | Add the `-webkit-backdrop-filter` property and a `background-color` with transparency as a fallback. |
| **Medium** | The watering can effect uses a hardcoded `setTimeout` to remove particle elements, which is brittle. If the CSS animation duration changes, this will break. | `docs/js/watering-can-effect.js` | Refactor to use the `animationend` event for element cleanup. |
| **Medium** | The CSS for gradient text (`background-clip: text`) has an incorrect property order, which prevents the solid `color` from acting as a proper fallback. | `docs/css/effects.css` | Move the fallback `color` property so it is defined *before* the `background-clip` rules. |
| **Low** | The watering can effect creates and destroys DOM elements inside a `setInterval` loop, which is inefficient. | `docs/js/watering-can-effect.js` | (Future Improvement) Refactor to use an object pool pattern for the particle elements to improve performance. |
