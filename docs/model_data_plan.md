# Model Data Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps for implementing the data-driven educational simulation. Each item will be checked off as it is completed.

- [x] **Create `docs/model_data_plan.md`**: Create this document and populate it with the full implementation plan. As I complete each of the following steps, I will update this file to mark the corresponding item as complete.
- [x] **Create Data and Schema Files**: Create the foundational data and schema files in the `docs/endpoints/` directory: `nodes.jsonschema`, `synapse.jsonschema`, `event.jsonschema`, `domain_mapping.json`, and `qa_fixture.json`.
- [x] **Draft Transformation Pipeline Pseudocode**: Create `docs/pseudocode_transformation_pipeline.md`.
- [x] **Enhance Existing CSS**: Read the existing `docs/css/model.css` to understand its current state and then update it by adding the specific styles for panels, buttons, and layouts as defined in the `model_component_breakdown.md`.
- [x] **Refactor `models.js` for Data-Driven Simulation**: This is the core of the work. Refactor the existing `docs/js/models.js` file to be data-driven.
- [x] **Verify `greenhouse.js` Integration**: Review the `loadModelsApplication` function in `docs/js/greenhouse.js` to ensure it correctly loads the module.
- [x] **Finalize Plan Document**: Before submission, do a final check to ensure `docs/model_data_plan.md` is fully updated with all steps marked as complete.
- [x] **Complete pre-commit steps**: Complete pre-commit steps to make sure proper testing, verifications, reviews and reflections are done.
- [ ] **Submit the change**: Once all tasks are complete, submit the changes.
