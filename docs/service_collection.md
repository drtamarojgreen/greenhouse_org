Creating the "Services" Collection:

  4. Name the Collection:
       * In the "Create Collection" dialog, for "Collection Name," enter Services (ensure exact spelling and
         capitalization).
       * The "Collection ID" will usually auto-generate based on the name (e.g., Services).
       * For "What's this collection for?," select "Site Content" (this is generally the most appropriate for
         data that your site will display or use).
       * Click "Create" or "Next".

  5. Define Fields for the "Services" Collection:
       * Once the Services collection is created, you'll be taken to its collection page.
       * The _id field is automatically created by Wix (it's the unique identifier for each item).
       * Click "+ Add Field" to add new fields. For the Services collection, we recommend:
           * Field 1: `name`
               * Field Name: name
               * Field Type: Text
               * Reference: No
               * Required: Yes (recommended)
               * Unique: Yes (recommended, so each service has a unique name)
           * Field 2: `description` (Optional)
               * Field Name: description
               * Field Type: Text
               * Reference: No
               * Required: No
           * (You can add other fields as needed, such e.g., `price`, `duration`, `imageUrl`.)
       * Click "Save" after adding each field.

  Creating the "Appointments" Collection:

  6. Start a New Collection:
       * Go back to the "Collections" list (usually by clicking "Collections" in the sidebar or a "Back"
         button).
       * Click "+ New Collection" again.

  7. Name the Collection:
       * For "Collection Name," enter Appointments (ensure exact spelling and capitalization).
       * The "Collection ID" will usually auto-generate (e.g., Appointments).
       * For "What's this collection for?," select "Site Content".
       * Click "Create" or "Next".

  8. Define Fields for the "Appointments" Collection:
       * The _id field is automatically created.
       * Click "+ Add Field" to add new fields. For the Appointments collection, we recommend:

  Revised Data Model Plan:

  A. `Services` Collection (No Change from previous instructions)
   * Fields: _id, name, description, priority, url

  B. `Appointments` Collection (Public/Anonymous)
   * Purpose: Stores public, non-sensitive appointment details. This is the collection that scheduling.jsw
     will primarily interact with for conflict checking and public display.
   * Key Change: Direct personal identifiers (like firstName, lastName) will NOT be stored here.
   * Fields to Create:
       * _id (auto-generated by Wix)
       * `anonymousId` (New Field):
           * Field Name: anonymousId
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: Yes
           * Unique: Yes (This will be a unique identifier generated by the backend for each appointment,
             linking to the private details.)
       * title (string)
       * start (Date and Time)
       * end (Date and Time)
       * platform (string)
       * serviceRef (Reference to Services collection _id)
       * date (Text, optional, for display)
       * time (Text, optional, for display)
       * confirmed (Boolean)
       * conflicts (Text)
       * `appointmentType` (New Field):
           * Field Name: appointmentType
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: Yes
           * Description: To distinguish how the appointment was scheduled (e.g., 'app-scheduled',
             'external-service').
       * owner (Reference to Members/Users collection, if applicable for Wix users)

  C. `PrivateAppointmentDetails` Collection (New, Private/Sensitive)
   * Purpose: Stores sensitive user information for appointments scheduled via the app. This collection must
     have very strict permissions (Admin only).
   * Fields to Create:
       * _id (auto-generated by Wix)
       * `anonymousIdRef` (New Field):
           * Field Name: anonymousIdRef
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: Yes
           * Unique: Yes (This will store the anonymousId from the Appointments collection to link the two
             records.)
       * `firstName`:
           * Field Name: firstName
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: Yes
       * `lastName`:
           * Field Name: lastName
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: Yes
       * `contactInfo` (New Field):
           * Field Name: contactInfo
           * Field Type: Text (e.g., for email or phone number)
           * Required: Yes
       * `referenceNumber` (Optional):
           * Field Name: referenceNumber
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: No
       * `notes` (Optional):
           * Field Name: notes
           * Field Type: Text
           * Required: No (for internal admin notes)
       * createdDate (Date and Time, auto-generated by Wix)
       * updatedDate (Date and Time, auto-generated by Wix)

  Action Plan for You (in Wix Editor):

   1. Create/Modify the `Appointments` Collection:
       * If you already started creating it, modify it to match the new fields above.
       * If not, create it as described, paying close attention to the anonymousId and appointmentType fields.
       * Remove firstName and lastName from this collection if you added them previously.

   2. Create the `PrivateAppointmentDetails` Collection:
       * Create a brand new collection with this name and the specified fields.

   3. Set Permissions for `PrivateAppointmentDetails`: This is CRITICAL.
       * For the PrivateAppointmentDetails collection, set the permissions so that only Admin roles can read,
         create, update, and delete content. This ensures the sensitive data remains private.

  I will now provide the detailed instructions for creating/modifying the Appointments collection and then
  creating the PrivateAppointmentDetails collection.

  Detailed Instructions for Creating/Modifying Collections (Revised)

  (Assuming you are already in the Wix Editor and Content Manager/Database section)

  1. Create/Modify the "Appointments" Collection:

       * If modifying an existing "Appointments" collection:
           * Select the "Appointments" collection from your list.
           * Go to its "Fields" tab.
           * Add Field: anonymousId (Type: Text, Required: Yes, Unique: Yes)
           * Add Field: appointmentType (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
           * Remove Fields: If you previously added firstName and lastName to this collection, delete them
             now.
           * Ensure all other fields (_id, title, start, end, platform, serviceRef, date, time, confirmed,
             conflicts, owner) are present as described in the "Revised Data Model Plan" above.

       * If creating a new "Appointments" collection:
           * Click "+ New Collection".
           * Collection Name: Appointments
           * What's this collection for?: Site Content
           * Click "Create".
           * Add the following fields:
               * anonymousId (Type: Text, Required: Yes, Unique: Yes)
               * title (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
               * start (Type: Date and Time, Required: Yes)
               * end (Type: Date and Time, Required: Yes)
               * platform (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
               * serviceRef (Type: Reference, Reference: Services collection, Required: Yes)
               * date (Type: Text, Required: No)
               * time (Type: Text, Required: No)
               * confirmed (Type: Boolean, Required: No)
               * conflicts (Type: Text, Required: No)
               * appointmentType (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
               * owner (Wix handles this, usually a Reference to Members/Users)
           * Click "Save" after adding each field.

  2. Create the "PrivateAppointmentDetails" Collection:

       * Go back to the "Collections" list.
       * Click "+ New Collection".
       * Collection Name: PrivateAppointmentDetails
       * What's this collection for?: Site Content
       * Click "Create".
       * Add the following fields:
           * anonymousIdRef (Type: Text, Required: Yes, Unique: Yes - this will store the anonymousId from the
              Appointments collection)
           * firstName (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
           * lastName (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
           * contactInfo (Type: Text, Required: Yes)
           * referenceNumber (Type: Text, Required: No)
           * notes (Type: Text, Required: No)
           * createdDate (Type: Date and Time, Wix auto-generates if set up)
           * updatedDate (Type: Date and Time, Wix auto-generates if set up)
       * Click "Save" after adding each field.

  3. Set Permissions for `PrivateAppointmentDetails` (CRITICAL):

       * While viewing the PrivateAppointmentDetails collection, or from the "Collections" list, find the
         "Permissions" or "Privacy" settings for this collection.
       * Configure the permissions as follows:
           * Who can read content: Admin
           * Who can create content: Admin
           * Who can update content: Admin
           * Who can delete content: Admin
       * This ensures that only authorized administrators can access this sensitive data.

  4. Publish Your Site:
       * After making all these changes, remember to publish your Wix site for them to take effect.

  This change will require significant updates to the backend code (services.jsw and scheduling.jsw) and the
   frontend (app.js) to handle the split data model. I will proceed with those code changes once you confirm
   these collection updates are understood.
