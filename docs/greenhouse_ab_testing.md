# Comprehensive A/B Testing Plan for Greenhouse Mental Health

## 1. Introduction

A/B testing (or split testing) is a powerful method for improving website performance by comparing two versions of a webpage to see which one better achieves a specific goal. For `greenhousemd.org`, the primary goal is to increase patient inquiries and appointment bookings.

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing A/B testing on the Wix platform.

**Important Limitation:** This plan serves as a strategic guide. The implementation, monitoring, and analysis of these tests must be performed by a human operator using Wix's A/B testing tools or a third-party service like Google Optimize.

## 2. Prerequisites & Setup

1.  **Enable Wix A/B Testing:** Your Wix plan must support the A/B testing feature. This is typically available on higher-tier plans. You can find this under "Marketing & SEO" in your Wix Dashboard.
2.  **Define Conversion Goals:** A "conversion" is the successful completion of a desired action. For this site, the primary conversion goal is a click on the **"Request to book" button**. This must be set up as a trackable event.
3.  **Install Analytics:** Ensure you have Wix Analytics or Google Analytics connected to your site to monitor metrics like bounce rate, time on page, and click-through rates.

## 3. A/B Testing Methodology

Follow this process for each test you run:

1.  **Identify an Element to Test:** Choose a single element on a key page that you believe can be improved (e.g., the main headline, a call-to-action button).
2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** State clearly what change you are making and what you expect the outcome to be. (e.g., "Changing the button text to be more direct will increase clicks.").
3.  **Create a Variation:** Use the Wix A/B testing tool to create a "Version B" of the page with your proposed change. The original is "Version A" (the control).
4.  **Set Traffic Allocation:** Start with a 50/50 split, where 50% of visitors see Version A and 50% see Version B.
5.  **Run the Test:** Launch the test and let it run until it reaches **statistical significance**. This means you have enough data to be confident the results aren't due to random chance. This could take several days or weeks, depending on your site traffic. Most testing tools will tell you when this is achieved.
6.  **Analyze the Results:** Compare the performance of Version B against Version A based on your primary conversion goal.
7.  **Implement the Winner:** If the variation (Version B) shows a statistically significant improvement, make it the permanent version for all visitors. If it performs the same or worse, stick with the original.
8.  **Iterate:** Use what you learned to inform your next test.

## 4. Specific A/B Test Plans

Here are four detailed test plans to start with.

*   **Page to Test:** Homepage
*   **Element to Change:** The text content within the "Background and Training" section.
*   **Version A (Control):** The current third-person text ("Ayodele Green, MD graduated from... She then went on to...").

*   **Primary Success Metric (KPI):** Average time on page.
*   **Secondary Metrics:** Scroll depth, click-through rate to the "Services" page.
