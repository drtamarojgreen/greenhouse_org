# Wix Velo Scheduler: Implementation Plan - Phase I: Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive technical roadmap for developing a centralized scheduling interface for medical and behavioral health practices within the Wix Velo ecosystem. This system is designed to aggregate appointments from multiple external platforms, provide robust administrative management tools, and ensure real-time synchronization with Google Calendar.

The project's complexity lies in integrating disparate third-party APIs (Zocdoc, SimplePractice, Kareo, Athenahealth), ensuring HIPAA-compliant data handling, and implementing a real-time conflict detection engine. This plan outlines the functional requirements, technical architecture, and implementation strategies required for a successful deployment.
