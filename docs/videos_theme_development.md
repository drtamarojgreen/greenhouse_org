# YouTube Curriculum Development Guide

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategic framework for developing a comprehensive and engaging mental health curriculum from The Greenhouse's YouTube channel. Our goal is to transform our extensive video library into a structured, intentional learning journey that empowers viewers to build knowledge, skills, and resilience. By organizing content into thematic learning paths, we can guide our audience from foundational concepts to advanced topics, fostering deeper understanding and long-term engagement.

This guide serves as a central resource for our development team, ensuring that all curriculum design, content curation, and video production aligns with our educational mission. It provides a clear, scalable process for identifying themes, structuring modules, and creating a cohesive viewer experience that is both informative and transformative.

## Content Themes

The following table categorizes our video content into thematic areas, forming the foundation of our curriculum. Each category and subcategory represents a potential learning module or series.

| Category                             | Subcategory                   | Description                                                                                                                                            |

## Curriculum Development Process

The process of developing a curriculum from our YouTube content will follow these iterative steps:

1.  **Theme Identification & Prioritization:**
    *   Analyze viewer engagement metrics (watch time, likes, comments) and community feedback to identify high-interest themes from the table above.
    *   Prioritize themes that align with our strategic goals, current mental health conversations, and opportunities for creating significant impact.

2.  **Content Audit & Curation:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive audit of existing videos within the prioritized theme.
    *   Curate a logical sequence of videos that builds knowledge progressively, starting with foundational concepts and moving to more complex topics.
    *   Identify content gaps where new videos may need to be created to ensure a complete and cohesive learning path.

3.  **Learning Path & Playlist Creation:**
    *   Structure the curated videos into a formal YouTube playlist, serving as a "learning module."
    *   Write clear, benefit-oriented titles and descriptions for each playlist, framing it as a course or workshop.
    *   Organize the videos within the playlist in a numbered, step-by-step sequence.

4.  **Supplemental Materials (Future Goal):**
    *   Develop supplementary materials such as worksheets, journal prompts, or guided-reading questions to accompany the video modules.
    *   Link to these resources in the video descriptions to create a more interactive and reflective learning experience.

5.  **Launch & Promotion:**
    *   Announce the new learning paths to our community through social media, newsletters, and on the YouTube channel itself.
    *   Create a dedicated section on our channel's homepage to feature these curated "courses."

## Future Directions

As this initiative evolves, we will explore opportunities to:
*   Integrate interactive elements such as quizzes or community discussion prompts.
*   Translate high-performing learning paths into different languages.
*   Collaborate with guest experts to co-create specialized modules.
*   Develop a dedicated "learning portal" on our website to host these structured courses.

This framework provides a scalable and intentional approach to transforming our content into a powerful educational resource. By focusing on structured learning, we can better serve our community's needs and deepen our impact in the mental health space.
