# Models Canvas Enhancements

This document lists 50 proposed enhancements for the Greenhouse Models Canvas visualization. These enhancements are designed to test the flexibility, rendering capability, and visual complexity of the system using the CanvasML pipeline.

## Layout Enhancements
1.  **Cluster - Central**: Position all icons and labels near the center of the canvas to test overlap and density.
2.  **Cluster - Corners**: Distribute elements to the four corners of the canvas to test spatial usage.
3.  **Linear - Horizontal**: Align all icons in a single horizontal row.
4.  **Linear - Vertical**: Align all icons in a single vertical column.
5.  **Grid Layout**: Arrange icons in a structured grid pattern.
6.  **Top Heavy**: Concentrate all elements in the top 30% of the canvas.
7.  **Bottom Heavy**: Concentrate all elements in the bottom 30% of the canvas.
8.  **Left Aligned**: Push all elements to the left side.
9.  **Right Aligned**: Push all elements to the right side.
10. **Spread Out**: Maximize the distance between elements.

## Styling & Scale Enhancements
11. **Text Heavy**: Increase font sizes for all labels to test text rendering prominence.
12. **Icon Heavy**: Increase the scale of all icons significantly.
13. **Balanced Scale**: Reset all elements to a uniform, medium scale.
14. **Giant Labels**: Set label font sizes to maximum readable values.
15. **Micro Labels**: Set label font sizes to minimum values.
16. **Giant Icons**: Maximize icon scale to dominate the canvas.
17. **Micro Icons**: Minimize icon scale.
18. **High Contrast**: Use fully opaque, distinct colors for all elements.
19. **Pastel Palette**: Use soft, semi-transparent colors.
20. **Monochrome**: Use varying shades of a single color (e.g., blue).

## Complexity & Content Enhancements
21. **High Density**: Add additional random icons to crowd the scene.
22. **Low Density**: Remove non-essential icons, keeping only the core set.
23. **Overlap Stress Test**: Intentionally overlap icons and text to test z-indexing and clarity.
24. **Noisy Background**: Add many small, scattered elements to create visual noise.
25. **Chaos Mode**: Randomize all properties (position, scale, color, content) for maximum entropy.

## Domain Specific & Narrative Enhancements
26. **Family Centric**: Significantly increase the scale of the Family icon and center it to emphasize family dynamics.
27. **Community Focus**: Significantly increase the scale of the Community icon and center it to emphasize social support.
28. **Society Dominance**: Place the Society icon at the top center and scale it up to represent structural influence.
29. **Stress Overload**: Highlight 'Environmental Stress' by increasing its font size drastically and changing color to red.
30. **Growth Focus**: Highlight 'Personal Growth' by increasing its font size and using a soothing green color.
31. **Genetic Emphasis**: Emphasize 'Genetic Factors' with large bold text and high contrast color.
32. **Family-Community Bridge**: Position Family and Community icons side-by-side to represent connection.
33. **Society-Individual Gap**: Place Society at the very top and Personal Growth at the very bottom to show separation.
34. **Environmental Pressure**: Crowd 'Personal Growth' with all other icons to simulate pressure.
35. **Support Triangle**: Arrange Family, Community, and Society in a tight triangle formation.
36. **Hidden Stress**: Render 'Environmental Stress' with low opacity and small font (insidious stress).
37. **Hidden Factors**: Render 'Genetic Factors' with minimal visibility.
38. **Overwhelming Society**: Scale Society icon to cover 50% of the canvas.
39. **Tiny Community**: Shrink Community icon to represent lack of support.
40. **Red Alert**: Color all icons red to simulate a crisis state.
41. **Blue Calm**: Color all icons blue to simulate a stable state.
42. **Dark Icons**: Render all icons in dark grey/black for high contrast against light backgrounds.
43. **Ghost Mode**: Set all icons to very low opacity (10%).
44. **Text Only**: Hide all icons (scale 0) to test text-only layout.
45. **Icon Only**: Hide all labels (font size 0) to test visual-only layout.
46. **Top-Left Quadrant**: Confine all elements strictly to the top-left quadrant.
47. **Bottom-Right Quadrant**: Confine all elements strictly to the bottom-right quadrant.
48. **Diagonal Stream**: Align all elements along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
49. **Anti-Diagonal**: Align all elements along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
50. **The Greenhouse**: Arrange icons structurally: Family (base), Community (walls), Society (roof).
