# Canvas Model Enhancements

This document lists 25 proposed visual enhancements for the Greenhouse Mental Health models visualizations. These enhancements are designed to improve aesthetic appeal, user engagement, and information conveyance.

## Brain Model Enhancements

1.  **Rainbow Activation**: Use HSL color cycling for neuron activation to represent different signal frequencies.
2.  **Hexagonal Grid**: Replace the square background grid with a hexagonal pattern for a more organic/scientific look.
3.  **Neon Mode**: Increase glow intensity and contrast for a "Cyberpunk" aesthetic.
4.  **Starry Background**: Add random static stars in dark mode for a deep space effect.
5.  **Pulse Wave**: Implement a global transparency pulse to simulate living tissue breathing.
6.  **Node Halos**: Draw multiple concentric rings around highly active nodes to visualize intensity zones.

## Synapse Model Enhancements

7.  **Bouncing Particles**: Neurotransmitters bounce off the synaptic cleft walls instead of disappearing.
8.  **Trail Effect**: Add fading trails to neurotransmitter particles to visualize flow direction.
9.  **Receptor Blink**: Receptors flash white briefly when they bind to a neurotransmitter.
10. **Gradient Background**: Replace flat background color with a vertical gradient (Darker at bottom).
11. **Particle Explosion**: Release particles in a burst pattern rather than a stream.
12. **Vesicle Wobble**: Animate vesicle shape to appear gelatinous/wobbly.
13. **ZigZag Path**: Add horizontal sine wave motion to falling particles.

## Environment Model Enhancements

14. **Day/Night Cycle**: Change sky color based on a simulated time of day.
15. **Rain Effect**: Overlay falling rain streaks for "Environmental Stress" visualization.
16. **Clouds**: Add moving cloud shapes to the background.
17. **Grass Texture**: Add procedural grass blades at the bottom of the viewport.
18. **Sun Rays**: Draw semi-transparent rays emanating from the top-left corner.
19. **Icon Bobbing**: Make static icons gently bob up and down.
20. **Vignette**: Add a dark vignette around the edges to focus attention on the center.
21. **Sepia Tone**: Apply a brownish tint for a "Nostalgic" or "Past Trauma" mode.
22. **Glitch Effect**: Randomly offset horizontal slices of the canvas to simulate anxiety/instability.
23. **Spotlight**: Darken the screen except for a circular area in the center.
24. **Paper Texture**: Add noise/grain to look like a drawing on paper.
25. **Blueprint Mode**: Change background to Blueprint Blue and lines to White.
