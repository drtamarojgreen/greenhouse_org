# 2025 End of Year Summary: Greenhouse for Mental Health Development

## Introduction

This report summarizes the key development projects undertaken in 2025 for the Greenhouse for Mental Health's digital infrastructure. The projects span a wide range of technologies and platforms, from a comprehensive patient portal to a mobile meditation application and a machine learning pipeline for 3D brain model analysis.

## Projects

### 1. MediTrack Patient Portal

A HIPAA and GDPR compliant healthcare application for managing patient records, appointments, therapy sessions, and medical assessments.

**Key Features:**

*   **Secure:** Multi-factor authentication, JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and field-level encryption for sensitive data.
*   **Comprehensive:** Manages patient demographics, appointments, vital signs, therapy sessions, and more.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript, with a PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Velo Backend Services

A collection of backend services for the main Wix website, `greenhousementalhealth.org`.

**Key Features:**

*   **Integrated:** Provides backend functionality for FAQs, guides, quizzes, and more, directly within the Wix platform.
*   **Seamless:** Uses Wix Velo's web modules to expose backend functions to the frontend.

### 3. Velo Interactive Scheduler

A frontend Velo application for the interactive appointment scheduler on the Greenhouse for Mental Health website.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive:** Allows users to dynamically filter services and therapists, select available time slots on a calendar, and book appointments in real-time.
*   **User-Friendly:** Uses a lightbox booking form for a smooth user experience.
*   **Integrated:** Fully integrated with the Velo backend functions for creating appointments and checking for conflicts.

### 4. Meditation Fields Mobile App

A web-based mobile application for meditation and wellness tracking.

**Key Features:**

*   **Holistic:** Tracks meditation, breathing rate, pulse, mood, and scheduling.
*   **Engaging:** Includes a guided meditation scene and a running routes map.
*   **Accessible:** Web-based application that can be accessed on any mobile device.

### 5. 3D Brain Model GNN Pipeline

A data processing pipeline for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that analyzes a 3D brain model.

**Key Features:**

*   **Cutting-Edge:** Preprocesses a 3D brain model (`brain.fbx`) for use in a GNN.
*   **In-Depth Analysis:** Extracts vertices, faces, normals, and curvature from the 3D model.
*   **Machine Learning Ready:** Saves the processed data as NumPy arrays, ready for a machine learning pipeline.

## Conclusion

The projects developed in 2025 represent a significant step forward for the Greenhouse for Mental Health's digital presence. The new patient portal, interactive scheduler, mobile app, and machine learning pipeline provide a solid foundation for future growth and innovation.
