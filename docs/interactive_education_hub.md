# Interactive Education Hub & Digital Greenhouse Experience

## Interactive Education Hub

- Visitors can click through guided explainers (like “What happens in therapy?” or “How anxiety affects the brain”).
- Use animations, illustrations, and short interactive quizzes.
- **Goal:** demystify mental health, reduce stigma, help people self-identify when they should seek care.

## Digital Greenhouse Experience

- Visual metaphor: the site feels like walking into a greenhouse.
- Visitors “grow a plant” as they browse—each click adds a leaf, flower, or ray of light.
- Subtle gamification: nurturing growth mirrors the therapeutic journey.
- **Goal:** create an emotional anchor that sticks with people.

## Conversation Simulations

- Short, branching dialogues: “How do I talk to my teen about therapy?” → interactive roleplay.
- Users pick responses, see outcomes, and learn communication strategies.
- **Goal:** make mental health advice actionable and relatable.

## Resource Toolkit

- Downloadable worksheets, video explainers, step-by-step coping guides.
- Filter by audience: Adult, Teen, Parent, Educator.
- **Goal:** make the site useful as a first stop for help, even if someone doesn’t book.
