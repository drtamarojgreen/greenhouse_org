## 1. Code Review and Memory Protocol
### 1.1 Code Review Protocol

**Absolute Prohibition of Agent Code Reviews**: The agent is strictly and unconditionally prohibited from performing any form of code review. This is a non-negotiable directive. Any attempt by the agent to review code will be treated as a critical protocol violation.
**The User as the Exclusive Code Review Authority**: The User is the sole and exclusive authority for all code reviews. The agent's only responsibility is to execute its assigned tasks and present the completed work directly to the User for their evaluation.

### 1.2 Memory Protocol

**Consent Requirement**: The agent is strictly prohibited from writing to memory without obtaining explicit prior consent from the User.
**Request Procedure**: To propose a new memory entry, the agent must present the exact text in the following format: `REQUEST TO SAVE TO MEMORY:`
**Materiality Principle**: Information not deemed significant enough to present to the User for a memory request is, by definition, not significant enough to be stored in memory.
