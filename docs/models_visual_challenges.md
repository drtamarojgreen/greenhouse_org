# 100 Visual Issues in Models Canvas

This document lists 100 specific visual issues identified from the provided screenshot of the Mental Health Environment canvas and sidebar interface.

## Canvas Area (Left)

1.  **Header Title Weight:** The "Mental Health Environment" title font weight appears inconsistent or slightly too bold for the size.
2.  **Subtitle Legibility:** The "micro-to-macro" subtitle is too small and lacks sufficient contrast against the background.
3.  **Header Alignment:** The vertical spacing above the header text is uneven compared to the bottom.
4.  **Header Background:** The white background of the header area cuts off abruptly against the gray canvas.
5.  **Canvas Background Color:** The light gray background feels dull and reduces contrast for white elements.
6.  **Grid Visibility:** The background grid lines are extremely faint, making them look like visual noise rather than a guide.
7.  **Grid Alignment:** The grid lines do not seem to align with the main central element's center point.
8.  **Hexagon Color:** The bright red color of the dotted hexagon vibrates unpleasantly against the gray background.
9.  **Hexagon Stroke Style:** The dotted line style of the hexagon is inconsistent in dot spacing.
10. **Hexagon Stroke Width:** The dots in the hexagon outline appear too thin and pixelated.
11. **Vertex Alignment:** The icons at the hexagon's vertices are not perfectly centered on the points.
12. **Icon Scaling:** The red icons on the hexagon vertices vary in visual weight and scale.
13. **Factory Icon Resolution:** The "Factory" icon appears pixelated or aliased.
14. **Person Icon Alignment:** The "Person" icon seems slightly off-center relative to its label.
15. **Tree Trunk Color:** The dark green of the tree trunk has poor contrast with the finer branches.
16. **Tree Branch Aliasing:** The curved lines of the tree branches show significant jaggedness (aliasing).
17. **Tree Label Legibility:** Small text labels attached to the tree structure are unreadable due to size.
18. **Tree Complexity:** The density of the tree branches creates a visual clutter in the center.
19. **Curve Smoothness:** The orange and blue connecting curves are not smooth; they look segmented.
20. **Curve Endpoints:** The connecting curves lack clear termination points (arrowheads or dots) at the tree.
21. **Tooltip Shadow:** The drop shadow on the top-right tooltip is too harsh and dark.
22. **Tooltip Connector:** The line connecting the tooltip to the element is too thin and barely visible.
23. **Connector Detachment:** The tooltip connector line seems to float, not clearly attaching to a specific source.
24. **Tooltip Border:** The green border of the tooltip is inconsistent with the internal content spacing.
25. **Tooltip Chart Resolution:** The bar chart inside the tooltip is blurry and lacks crisp edges.
26. **Tooltip Text Blurring:** The text "Building City..." inside the tooltip is rendered with sub-pixel blurring.
27. **Tooltip Axis Labels:** The axis labels on the chart in the tooltip are illegible.
28. **Legend Position:** The legend box at the bottom right feels like it's floating without an anchor.
29. **Legend Text Size:** The text in the legend ("Influences", "Family", etc.) is too small to read comfortably.

33. **Legend Title Color:** The "Influences" title color (green) is difficult to read at that size.
34. **Canvas Margins:** The whitespace around the central graphic is unbalanced (more space at bottom than top).
35. **Node Overlap:** Some text labels on the hexagon overlap with the grid lines poorly.
36. **Star Icon Style:** The star icon style is filled while others are outlined or detailed, lacking consistency.
37. **Hexagon Label Contrast:** The red labels on the hexagon have low contrast against the gray background.
38. **Tree Roots:** The tree lacks a visual representation of roots, making it look cut off at the bottom.
39. **Central Node:** The center point where branches diverge is visually muddy.
40. **Blue Node Floating:** A small blue oval node near the tree trunk appears to be floating without connection.
41. **Green Node Icon:** The green icon on the right side of the tree is indiscernible.
42. **Curved Line Color:** The cyan color of one connecting line is too light against the background.
43. **Dotted Line Ends:** The hexagon dotted line segments end abruptly at the icons without a clean transition.
44. **Canvas Resolution:** The entire canvas area seems to be rendered at a lower resolution than the sidebar text.
45. **Text Kerning:** The kerning in "Mental Health Environment" is slightly uneven.

47. **Grid Pattern:** The grid pattern does not extend all the way to the edges of the canvas container.
48. **Icon Style Mix:** There is a mix of flat and slightly 3D-looking icons.
49. **Label Alignment:** Text labels on the hexagon are not consistently aligned relative to their icons.
50. **Visual Hierarchy:** The tree dominates too much, making the surrounding hexagon factors hard to focus on.

## Sidebar Area (Right)

51. **Top Empty Box:** There is a large, empty gray box at the top of the sidebar with no content.
52. **Sidebar Card Shadow:** The drop shadows on the sidebar cards are slightly green-tinted and heavy.
53. **Card Border Radius:** The corners of the sidebar cards are very rounded, contrasting with the sharper tooltip.
54. **Card Border Color:** The cards have a faint green outline that clashes with the shadow.
55. **Title Alignment:** The "Simulation Controls (synaptic)" title is left-aligned but the underline seems full width.
56. **Title Hierarchy:** The word "(synaptic)" is in parentheses and on a second line, making it look secondary but it's bold.
57. **Slider Label Spacing:** The "Practice Intensity" label is too close to the slider track.
58. **Slider Track Visibility:** The inactive part of the slider track is a faint gray, hard to see.
59. **Slider Thumb Size:** The slider thumb (circle) is quite small, which might make it hard to grab.
60. **Slider Color:** The green active color of the slider doesn't match the header green exactly.
61. **Dropdown Label Alignment:** "Simulation Speed" is on the same line as the dropdown, creating a jagged right edge.
62. **Dropdown Background:** The gray background of the dropdown button looks disabled.
63. **Dropdown Arrow:** The arrow icon in the dropdown is tiny.
64. **Button Colors:** Both "Play" and "Reset Plasticity" buttons use the same maroon color, implying equal weight.

70. **"How to Use" Title:** The title font size is smaller than the Simulation Controls title.
71. **Body Text Line Height:** The paragraph text in "How to Use" has tight line spacing.
72. **Body Text Color:** The gray text color in "How to Use" is a bit too light for optimal readability.

74. **Network Graph Card:** The card containing the network graph lacks a title or label.
75. **Network Node Blur:** The nodes in the network graph preview are very blurry.
76. **Network Edge Visibility:** The lines connecting nodes in the network graph are extremely faint.
77. **Network Graph Background:** The gray background of the network graph box is too similar to the canvas background.
78. **Duplicate Controls:** The "Simulation Controls (network)" card looks identical to the synaptic controls, causing confusion.
79. **Scrollbar Absence:** There is no visible scrollbar despite the content likely exceeding the viewport height.
80. **Sidebar Background:** The white background of the sidebar makes the cards float rather than sit on a surface.
81. **Card Spacing:** The vertical space between sidebar cards is inconsistent (e.g., larger gap after the empty box).
82. **Empty Box Purpose:** The top empty box looks like a broken image or missing component.
83. **Control Grouping:** The buttons are separated from the slider/dropdown by a large gap.
84. **Slider Label Color:** The "Practice Intensity" label is gray, while the title is maroon.
85. **Dropdown Text Alignment:** The text "Normal" in the dropdown is not vertically centered perfectly.
86. **Reset Button Text Wrap:** "Reset Plasticity" is two words but forced onto one line in a pill button.
87. **Sidebar Alignment:** The top of the sidebar content does not align with the top of the canvas header.
88. **Card Width:** The cards do not seem to span the full width of the sidebar column evenly.
89. **Shadow Cutoff:** The shadow on the right side of the cards seems slightly clipped.
90. **Network Graph Node Color:** The gray nodes on a gray background have very poor contrast.
91. **Instructions Clarity:** The "How to Use" text is a wall of text without bullet points or bold keywords.
92. **Visual Balance:** The sidebar feels heavy on the right compared to the open space on the canvas.
93. **Icon consistency:** Sidebar icons (if any) are missing, relying solely on text.
94. **Slider Knob Style:** The slider knob has a white fill and gray border, which looks a bit dated.
95. **Section Dividers:** Within the control cards, there are no dividers between the inputs and buttons.
96. **Title Underline:** The green underline under the card titles is too thin.
97. **Sidebar Width:** The sidebar seems to take up a significant portion of the screen (approx 25-30%).
98. **Font Family:** The font in the sidebar looks like a generic sans-serif, possibly different from the canvas.
99. **Color Palette:** The mix of maroon, green, and gray in the sidebar feels slightly disjointed.
