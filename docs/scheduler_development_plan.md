# Scheduler Application Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for completing the Greenhouse for Mental Health appointment scheduler. It details the initial state of the application, the strategic plan for its completion, and the progress made.

## 1. Initial State of the Application

The project began with a set of backend Velo (Wix) functions that were largely complete and a frontend that was a non-functional prototype.

*   **Backend (`/apps/wv/backend/`):**
    *   Core API functions for creating and retrieving appointments, services, and therapists were already implemented (`createAppointment.web.js`, `getServices.web.js`, etc.).
    *   The backend correctly used Wix Data Collections (`Services`, `Therapists`, `Appointments`) as defined in the `scheduler_design_plan.md`.
    *   The `createAppointment` function included logic for preventing double-booking and sending a confirmation email.

*   **Frontend (`/apps/frontend/schedule/Schedule.js`):**
    *   The code contained placeholder functions for loading calendar availability and time slots.
    *   Business logic (like calculating available times) was incorrectly placed on the client-side and was incomplete.
    *   There was no code for the booking form lightbox.
    *   Error handling and UI state management were minimal.

## 2. Development Strategy & Plan

To complete the application, a five-phase plan was executed. The strategy was to first strengthen the backend by centralizing key business logic, then build out the frontend to connect to the new backend functions, create the booking form, and finally polish the user experience.

### Phase 1: Backend Enhancements & Logic Centralization

The goal was to move all availability calculations to the backend to ensure a single source of truth and improve performance and security.

1.  **Create `getAvailabilityForTherapist.web.js`:** A new backend function to calculate and return the specific available time slots for a given therapist on a given day.
2.  **Create `getMonthlyAvailability.web.js`:** A new backend function to return a high-level summary of which days in a month are available or fully booked, allowing the frontend calendar to be rendered efficiently.

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation - Calendar and Time Slots

This phase focused on connecting the main scheduler UI to the new, more intelligent backend functions.

1.  **Implement `loadCalendarAvailability`:** The frontend function was rewritten to call `getMonthlyAvailability.web.js` and use the response to disable unavailable dates in the calendar component.
2.  **Implement `loadTimeSlotsForDate`:** The frontend function was rewritten to call `getAvailabilityForTherapist.web.js` and display the returned time slots to the user.

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation - Booking Form

This phase involved creating the user-facing booking form as a Wix Lightbox.

1.  **Create `bookingForm.js`:** A new file was created to contain the logic for the booking form lightbox.
2.  **Implement Lightbox Logic:** The code handles gathering user input, calling the `createAppointment.web.js` backend function to finalize the booking, and displaying any validation or booking-conflict errors.
3.  **Update `Schedule.js`:** The main scheduler page was updated to pass the necessary data (including human-readable names for service and therapist) to the lightbox.

### Phase 4: Polishing and Final Touches

This phase focused on improving the overall user experience.

1.  **Implement User-Facing Error Messages:** `console.log` errors were replaced with user-friendly messages on the UI for all data-fetching operations.
2.  **Refine UI State Management:** Logic was added to disable buttons and dropdowns during data loading to provide clear feedback to the user and prevent invalid actions.
3.  **Confirm Post-Booking Refresh:** Ensured that the calendar availability would automatically refresh after a successful booking.

### Phase 5: Documentation

This final phase involved creating this document to serve as a comprehensive record of the development process.

## 3. Conclusion

By executing this plan, the scheduler application was successfully brought from a prototype stage to a feature-complete and robust state, following the specifications outlined in the initial design documents.
