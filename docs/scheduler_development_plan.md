# Scheduler Application Development Summary (As-Built)

**Status: This document reflects the actual development process of the currently implemented scheduler and supersedes any previous plans.**

This document summarizes the development of the Greenhouse for Mental Health appointment scheduler, from its initial prototype state to its current implementation.

## 1. Initial State of the Application

The project began with a set of backend Velo functions and a largely non-functional frontend prototype.

*   **Backend (`/apps/wv/backend/`):**
    *   A suite of core API functions for managing appointments and services was already in place (e.g., `createAppointment.web.js`, `getServices.web.js`, `getAppointments.web.js`, `proposeAppointment.web.js`). These functions provided the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations necessary for an appointment system.
    *   The backend included the crucial `proposeAppointment` function, which contains the business logic for conflict detection.

*   **Frontend (`/apps/frontend/schedule/Schedule.js`):**
    *   The initial frontend code was a placeholder with a structure for three distinct views (Patient, Dashboard, Admin).
    *   It contained numerous references to UI elements that did not exist or were not functional.
    *   The user flow was not implemented, and there was minimal error handling or state management.
    *   Crucially, early versions relied on Wix Lightboxes for forms, a feature that was later removed, as indicated by comments in the final code.

## 2. Implemented Development Strategy

The development strategy that was actually executed focused on building a simplified, single-form application for patients, while leveraging the existing backend functions. The complex, multi-step process involving therapist selection and interactive availability calendars (as described in early design plans) was **not implemented**.

The development process consisted of the following key stages:

### Stage 1: Frontend Scaffolding and View Management

The primary effort was to make the three-view structure functional.

1.  **View Logic Implementation:** The `initScheduler` function was developed to manage the visibility of the three main containers (`#patientContainer`, `#dashboardContainer`, `#adminContainer`), ensuring only one is visible at a time. The default view was correctly set to the patient container.
2.  **UI Element Mapping:** The `schedulerState.uiElements` object was populated with the correct IDs for all the interactive elements from the Wix editor, creating a reliable mapping for the code to use.

### Stage 2: Implementing the Patient View

This stage focused on building the core user-facing functionality: the appointment request form.

1.  **Form Logic:** The `initializePatientApp` function and its helpers were implemented. This involved:
    *   Connecting the "Request Appointment" button to an event listener.
    *   Gathering values from the various input fields (`title`, `date`, `time`, `platform`, `service`).
    *   Calling the backend `proposeAppointment` and `createAppointment` functions.
2.  **Data Population:** Logic was implemented to call the `getServices` and `getAppointments` backend functions to populate the service dropdown and the user's list of existing appointments. A manual "Load Data" button was implemented to adhere to the requirement of avoiding automatic data fetches.
3.  **Client-Side Validation:** Basic client-side validation logic was added to ensure required fields were filled out before submission.
4.  **Error and Success Messaging:** The `displayError` and `displaySuccess` functions were implemented to provide users with feedback after submitting the form or encountering a conflict.

### Stage 3: Implementing the Dashboard and Admin Views

These ancillary views were built out to provide staff-level functionality.

1.  **Dashboard Implementation:** The `initializeDashboardApp` function was built to fetch and display data for the weekly schedule table and the conflict list repeater, using the existing `getAppointmentsByDateRange` and `getConflictsForDateRange` backend functions.
2.  **Admin View Implementation:** The `initializeAdminApp` function was developed to fetch the data for a single appointment (based on a URL query parameter) and populate a detailed editing form. Event listeners for the "Save" and "Delete" buttons were added to call the corresponding `updateAppointment` and `deleteAppointment` backend functions.

## 3. Conclusion

The development process resulted in a functional, albeit simplified, scheduler application. The final product deviates significantly from the ambitious multi-step flow envisioned in early design documents, instead favoring a more direct, form-based approach for appointment requests. The implemented application correctly utilizes the existing backend infrastructure for its core logic.
