# Comprehensive CSS Analysis and Recommendations for /schedule/

This document provides a consolidated summary of three different CSS analysis reports for the `/schedule/` page, along with specific recommendations for refactoring `docs/css/schedule.css`.

## **CRITICAL ISSUE: CSS Not Applying Due to Selector Mismatch**

**Problem:** The fundamental issue preventing styles in `docs/css/schedule.css` from working as intended is that **nearly all CSS rules are scoped to a non-existent parent element: `#greenhouse-app-container`.**

Analysis of the live page's HTML structure reveals that the scheduler application's components are rendered inside various Wix containers (e.g., `<div id="comp-mf2vtvp0">`), and the specific elements of the app have their own unique IDs (e.g., `<div id="greenhouse-patient-app-calendar-container">`).

The CSS is written with the assumption of a single, wrapping container that does not exist on the live page. This means the browser does not apply the vast majority of the styles.

**Impact:**
- The application is likely rendering with broken or missing styles.
- Any attempt to fix individual styles without addressing this core architectural problem will fail or lead to highly fragile, unmaintainable CSS.

**This issue must be addressed before any other refactoring.**

## Proposed CSS Architecture to Fix Targeting Issues

To resolve the critical selector mismatch, the CSS architecture must be refactored to be independent of the Wix page structure. The reliance on a single, top-level ID must be replaced with a robust, class-based system.

### The Strategy: Component-Based, Class-Driven CSS

1.  **Eliminate the `#greenhouse-app-container` dependency:** Remove this ID selector from every rule in `docs/css/schedule.css`.
2.  **Assign Unique Classes to Components:** Each distinct part of the application (calendar, patient form, instructions list, view selector) should have its own unique, high-level class name. These classes should be added to the root element of each component by the JavaScript that renders them.
3.  **Use Descendant Selectors from Component Classes:** All styles for a component should descend from its unique class. This ensures styles are correctly scoped and do not rely on the unpredictable IDs generated by Wix.

This approach makes the styles portable, predictable, and resilient to changes in the surrounding page structure.

### Concrete Refactoring Examples for `docs/css/schedule.css`

Here is how to apply this strategy to the existing CSS, using the actual HTML structure as a guide.

#### Example 1: Refactoring the Calendar Styles

- **The Problem:** The calendar is inside `<div id="greenhouse-patient-app-calendar-container">`. The CSS uses `#greenhouse-app-container .calendar-header`. This does not work.
- **The Solution:** The JavaScript should add a class, e.g., `schedule-calendar`, to the main container. The CSS can then be refactored.

**Before:**
```css
#greenhouse-app-container .calendar-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

#greenhouse-app-container .calendar-header h2 {
    /* ... */
}
```

**After (with new class `.schedule-calendar`):**
```css
/* Note the removal of the ID and the use of a component-specific class */
.schedule-calendar .calendar-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

.schedule-calendar .calendar-header h2 {
    /* ... */
}
```

#### Example 2: Refactoring the Patient Form Styles

- **The Problem:** The form styles are scoped to `#greenhouse-app-container form`, but the form has its own ID (`#greenhouse-patient-appointment-form`) and an existing class (`.greenhouse-form`).
- **The Solution:** We can use the existing `.greenhouse-form` class, which is much more resilient than an ID.

**Before:**
```css
#greenhouse-app-container form {
    background-color: var(--form-bg, #ffffff);
    padding: var(--spacing-xl, 2rem);
    /* ... */
}

#greenhouse-app-container label {
    display: block;
    /* ... */
}

#greenhouse-app-container .greenhouse-btn-primary,
#greenhouse-app-container button {
    background-color: var(--primary-green, #357438);
    color: var(--white, #fff);
}
```

**After (using the existing `.greenhouse-form` class):**
```css
/* Target the form directly by its own class */
.greenhouse-form {
    background-color: var(--form-bg, #ffffff);
    padding: var(--spacing-xl, 2rem);
    /* ... */
}

/* Use descendant selectors from the form's class */
.greenhouse-form label {
    display: block;
    /* ... */
}

/* Similarly, scope buttons within the form if they are unique to it */
.greenhouse-form button {
    background-color: var(--primary-green, #357438);
    color: var(--white, #fff);
}
```

#### Example 3: Refactoring the Modal Styles

- **The Problem:** The modal styles also depend on the non-existent `#greenhouse-app-container`.
- **The Solution:** Since the modal is likely a single, app-wide component, its class can be used directly without a parent selector.

**Before:**
```css
.greenhouse-app-container .greenhouse-modal {
    display: none;
    position: fixed;
    /* ... */
}
```

**After:**
```css
/* The modal class is specific enough to not need a parent selector */
.greenhouse-modal {
    display: none;
    position: fixed;
    /* ... */
}
```

## Report 1: W3C CSS Validation Summary

A W3C CSS validation check was performed against CSS level 3 + SVG, resulting in **91 errors** and **1200 warnings**.

### Key Findings
- **False Positives from Modern/Experimental Features:** The majority of errors and warnings are not critical bugs but are due to the validator's inability to parse modern CSS features. This includes:
    - **Experimental APIs:** The View Transitions API (`@view-transition`, `::view-transition`, etc.) is not recognized.
    - **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** The validator cannot statically check the validity of `var()` outputs, leading to hundreds of warnings.
    - **Newer CSS Modules:** Properties like `container-type` and units like `1cqw` from the Container Queries spec are flagged as unknown.
- **Legitimate Issues to Investigate:**
    - **Invalid `mix-blend-mode` value:** `plus-lighter` is not a standard value.
    - **Vendor Prefixes and Deprecated Properties:** While expected, the high number of vendor-prefixed properties and deprecated properties like `clip` suggests a need for better CSS post-processing and modernization.

## Report 2: Project Wallace CSS Code Quality Summary

This report provides an opinionated score on the overall quality of the CSS, focusing on maintainability, complexity, and performance.

- **Maintainability Score:** 58/100 (Medium)
- **Complexity Score:** 71/100 (Medium)
- **Performance Score:** 56/100 (Medium)

### Key Findings
- **High Complexity:** The CSS suffers from overly complex selectors (up to 43 complexity points) and high specificity, with **13.5% of selectors using IDs**. This makes the CSS difficult to override and maintain.
- **Poor Maintainability:** A very large ruleset containing **417 declarations** (mostly CSS variables) makes it hard to manage theme properties. The report also notes that over 60% of selectors are more complex than the most common selector pattern in the file.
- **Performance Issues:**
    - **Filesize:** At **309 kB**, the CSS file is quite large.
    - **Declaration Duplication:** **55.8% of declarations are duplicated**, indicating a lack of abstraction and reusable classes.
    - **Embedded Content:** 11 embedded items (mostly SVGs) contribute 6.47 kB to the filesize.

## Report 3: Project Wallace CSS Analyzer (Detailed Metrics)

This report provides a deep dive into the raw metrics of the stylesheet.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Lines of Code:** 8,493
- **Selectors:** 2,156 total selectors, with 1,636 being unique.
- **Declarations:** 6,170 total declarations.
- **`!important` Usage:** 195 instances of `!important` (3.16% of declarations), which is a sign of specificity issues.
- **Custom Properties:** 753 custom properties are defined.
- **Units:** `px` is the most used unit (1,221 times), indicating a potential lack of responsive units in some areas.

## General Recommendations for `docs/css/schedule.css`

These are general best practices that should be applied during the refactoring process.

### 1. Adopt a Naming Convention (like BEM)
The current CSS uses a mix of ID selectors, generic tag selectors, and some class-based selectors. This leads to inconsistent specificity and makes the code hard to reason about.

**Recommendation:** Refactor the CSS to follow a consistent naming convention like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier).

*Example: Refactoring form styles*
```css
/* --- BEFORE --- */
.greenhouse-form-field { ... }
.greenhouse-form-submit-btn { ... }


/* --- AFTER (BEM Style) --- */
.schedule-form__field { ... } /* Element */
.schedule-form__submit { ... } /* Element */
```

### 2. Consolidate and Abstract Common Styles
There is significant code duplication. For example, `.service-a`, `.service-b`, and `.service-c` are defined twice with the same values. Table styles are also repeated.

**Recommendation:** Create reusable utility classes and consolidate component styles.

- **Remove Duplicated Service Color Classes:** Define them only once.
- **Refactor Button Styles:** Create a single base `.btn` class and use modifiers for variations.
```css
/* Base button style */
.btn {
    padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
    border: 1px solid transparent;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-weight: 600;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

/* Modifier for primary button */
.btn--primary {
    background-color: var(--primary-green, #357438);
    color: var(--white, #fff);
}
.btn--primary:hover {
    background-color: var(--primary-green-dark, #2a5a2c);
}

/* Modifier for secondary button */
.btn--secondary {
    background-color: transparent;
    border-color: var(--border-color, #ced4da);
    color: var(--text-dark, #212529);
}
.btn--secondary:hover {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
}
```
- **Consolidate Table Styles:** The styles for `.schedule-table` and `table:not(.schedule-table)` are very similar. They could be merged into a base `.table` class with modifiers for specific variations.

### 3. Reduce Specificity
Once the primary targeting issue is resolved, continue to favor low-specificity selectors. Avoid long chains of selectors and unnecessary nesting.

**Recommendation:**
- Replace complex selectors like `table tr:nth-child(odd) td:nth-child(even)` with simpler classes applied directly to the elements (e.g., `.cell--shaded`). This is more readable and performant.

### 4. Organize the CSS File Structure
The file lacks a clear, organized structure, with related styles scattered throughout.

**Recommendation:** Structure the file with clear comment blocks for different sections.
```css
/* ==========================================================================
   1. Design System & Variables (if any are local)
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   2. Base & Generic Styles (e.g., body, form resets)
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   3. Utility Classes (e.g., .text-center, .margin-top-20)
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   4. Component: Forms
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   5. Component: Buttons
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   6. Component: Tables / Schedule
   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   7. Component: Modal
   ========================================================================== */
```
